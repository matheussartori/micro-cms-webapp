# Get posts

## Functional requirements
- Users should be able to view blog posts. Additionally, they should have the option to search for blog posts by entering keywords or phrases in a search bar and retrieve relevant results.

## Business rules
- When the posts list page loads, the blog posts should be rendered.
- When the user types text in the search bar, they should see an autocomplete feature with the search results.
- Clicking on an autocomplete option from the search bar should redirect the user to the blog post page.
- All posts should be rendered without pagination since they are stored in the browser's local storage.
