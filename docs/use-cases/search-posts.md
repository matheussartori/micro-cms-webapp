# Search posts

## Functional requirements
- Users should be able to search for blog posts, by entering keywords or phrases in a search bar and retrieve relevant results.

## Non-functional requirements
- The search component must be implemented as a controlled component, utilizing Redux for state management and filtering data from the local storage.

## Business rules
- When the user types text in the search bar, they should see an autocomplete feature with the search results.
- Clicking on an autocomplete option from the search bar should redirect the user to the blog post page.
